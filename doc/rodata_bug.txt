--- The OS doesn't boot when I add string constants  ---
Edit 'linker.ld', and replace each instance of 'rodata' by 'rdata'.

--- A global symbol in .rdata section is suddenly random garbage ---
Don't declare it in `.rdata`, but in `.rodata` instead.
```asm
	.section .rodata
	.global hello_world
	.type hello_world, @common
hello_world:
	.asciz "Hello World! It works! It's awesome!"
```
